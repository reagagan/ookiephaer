I’ll be graduating with a BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from University of Sheffield, UK. I expect to score a borderline 1st class honours ( maybe a very high 2.1), which I believe is roughly equivalent with a 5.5/6 in the Swiss academic system (correct me if I’m wrong). One year semi-relevant engineering RampD internship experience with a top-class motorsport/automotive British company (I’. COMSOL LiveLink for MATLAB — купить в интернет-магазине Store.softline: описание, цены, online заказ, консультация по лицензированию COMSOL LiveLink for MATLAB. Продажа лицензионного программного обеспечения от Microsoft, Adobe. I'm looking for a toolbox or library to simulate classical mechanics problems usually found in textbooks. I want to for example see the oscillations of a usual double pendulum problem with ability to plot angles and forces at arbitrary positions. Or physical parameters of "box on a cart with friction" problem or real-time animation of a N-body problem. It'd be nice if it also supports 3d. 1- In summary, suppose someone wants to go through Landau-Lifshitz or Goldstein books.

Hi guys and gals, I am building a work PC for my engineer friend, he says he want to use engineering programs on it such as cisco packet trace,matlab,comsol. and what not. I have never built a non gaming PC, so I am not sure on how to give him the best performance for his money without wasting money on gaming stuff. he doesn't care about gaming thats why I didn't pick a graphics card I figure he can use the integrated GPU, or should I pick a low tired GPU? his budget is around 1300-1600.  Если на компьютере установлены MATLAB и COMSOL, то запуск COMSOL можно осуществить с рабочего стола Windows или кнопкой "Пуск" ("Программы", "COMSOL with MATLAB. 
So, even though I am a metallurgical engg. student, I was always interested in getting software development internships and jobs. I am looking for internships this summer 2019. I have applied to around 20-30 companies though linkedIn,but none of them replied. So, what else is missing from my CV or what else can I do to make the CV better which will shortlist me for interviews. I have just mentioned all the points in my CV below : amp#x200B; amp#x200B; \----- begin \----- Country:. Hello, amp#x200B; How useful is COMSOL? If we for example look at MATLAB, it is a programming language that is used extensively in research and RampD but not much otherwise. Is it the same case with COMSOL, ie not used much outside scientific work/research. Integrated Modeling using MatLab, Simulink and COMSOL, 978-3-639-10669-5, This book presents the development and evaluation ofan integrated heat, air and moisture simulationenvironment for modeling and simulating dynamicheat, air and moisture processes in buildings andsystems. All models are implemented in thecomputational software package. I am planning to finally upgrade my cpu/mobo/ram set since 2012. The new set will be replacing my trusty old i5-3570k. I'm looking to spend around﻿ around ±700 euros for the complete set and I'll be combining it with my GTX 1080. The cpu will be cooled using a kraken x62. Currently I'm deciding on these parts: - Corsair Vengeance LPX series (16GB DDR4 3200Mhz) €140 ﻿ - ASRock Z370 Extreme4 €150 - Either i7-8700k €450 boxed / €415 tray or i7-9700k €460 boxed / €450 65834812НЕ могу понять что от меня хочет COMSOL 5.0 with MATLAB когда я открываю его Когда вводите пароль то ничего не меняется внешне, но программа пароль воспринимает. Hello all, I am doing my masters about sustainable energy/PEM fuel cells. I studied mechanical engineering in my bachelor and was very interested in fluid mechanics. I think I am a good ANSYS-Fluent user and I am also proficient on ANSYS-ICEM CFD, I co-authored 2 SCI papers about CFD modelling of PEM fuel cells via Fluent during my bachelor. In this semester I took CFD and turbulence theory courses as an electives, however the problem is that the courses are full of theory and only deals. Вы не можете добавлять комментарии в эту тему.

To all the engineers who deal mainly with computational simulation/modeling for their jobs, what advice would you give to a student looking to get into that area of industry? Im a junior in ChE and all I have going for me is Differential Equations and Statistics; Im pretty good at MATLAB and R, and am learning COMSOL and python for some of my courses like fluids right now. Do you guys recommend taking more math or CS classes to get better at developing my skills for simulation/modeling? Thanks. Hello everyone, Would anyone have a good recommendation for a college laptop/tablet with touchscreen and a pen? I would like to be able to use it for taking notes in one note and being able to write documents with office. If it could run programs like matlab and comsol (to an extent because those programs can be very tasking) then that would be great. My budget as I said is 00. Im fairly knowledgeable with laptops/computers but I don’t want to be taken advantage of if I go to a store. Hello! I graduated last year with my bachelors in biomedical engineering and I’ll do just about anything to be an engineer. Currently, I work as a systems analyst with a utility company and it is the most boring, mind numbing job I could have ever imagined and since I’m not ready to give up on my dream of being an engineer I’ve come here for help/advice. I have a great set of skills that I’ve acquired from university and I’m looking for a position where I can really refine those and learn. gtHello, fellow LinkedIn-ers. I’m a biomedical engineer with an interest in medical innovations - especially those relating to orthopedic implants, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes care. In the past, my main focus had been in biomechanics research, where I was a part of a team that recorded and studied motion captures of exercises like gait and indoor rowing. I also studied orthopedic implant design and have designed and analyzed various implants from the ankle all the way to the jaw. I’m. 
Hi, I am an M.tech Chemical engineer my graduation and post graduation from the Indian university, my specialization research area on Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) and my background focus on fluid mechanics with Reaction, Heat Transfer and Mass transfer model with the capillary microreactor and a periodically lid-driven cavity in CFD. I have extensive experience in working with Comsol Multiphysics® and MATLAB software (2 years). After pass out from my university Total budget and country of purchase: up to 650€ (~750 $), Germany Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Specifications should fit my needs. Battery should last at least 3 hours when working with excel, outlook etc. How important is weight and thinness to you? 7/10 Which OS do you require? Windows. Do you have a preferred screen size? 15' should include NUM-Pad Are you doing any CAD/v. Hey guys, hope all is well! So a bit of background: So as a little off the books work/my own research and learning I want to utilize Linux to run some hpc software such as Calculix, Blender, Octave, Scilab,C++/Python, Comsol multiphysics etc. along with my windows running matlab, ansys, and visual studios to learn about differences (even run linux version fo Ansys and matlab), similarities and special case scenarios like custom simulations. As well using linux for other things I normally 
I love COMSOL. It is as minimalist as it needs to be, it shows you the exact equations being solved, it's very easy to parameterize, use with Matlab, input custom equations at any step, and looks clean. ANSYS looks like a mess. Parameterizing things is exceedingly complicated, and everything opens a new window. Even in the documentation it is often difficult to see what exact equations are being solve for, much less the shape functions being used. Maybe this is just my bias having Hello! I'm off to do a master's degree this August (in physics!), and I'm really liking the MacBook! I like it a lot because of its small form factor (I will be walking or cycling the entire time so having something light is a must!), its lack of fan, and of course aesthetics! A rose gold laptop is a dream! However I did have some questions to make sure that it will fit my needs! I will be getting the mid tier model with the m5 processor :) 1. Is it reasonably powerful for normal ###Build Ready: Have you read the sidebar and rules ( (Please do) Yes What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better. The build is intended for gaming, work and schoolwork. Schoolwork includes some light work in solidworks, comsol multiphysics and matlab. If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings) I want to be able to play on 1920x1080 at 60fps. 
I graduated from Arizona State University in May with a B.S. in biomedical engineering, and I'm looking for any contract of full time positions. I'm interested in regulatory affairs, RampD or just about anything else that is somewhat related to the field. If anyone has any leads or suggestions please pm me. My skills include the following: Computer Programming: C++ and MATLAB Technical writing including FDA QSR/GMP compliance Computer assisted modeling and simulation: COMSOL, Solidwor. So I installed VMware 12 player to try out some linux vm for some self learning. I have a pretty capable system with a 5960x and a gtx 970 for 3D openGL acceleration. A little background on why I want to run linux: So as a little off the books work/my own research and learning I want to utilize linux to run some hpc software such as Calculix, Blender, Octave, Scilab,C++/Python, Comsol multiphysics etc. along with my windows running matlab, ansys, and visual studios to learn about differences. We did this experiment like a week ago and the report is due on Monday. The professor said he would explain what he wanted in this week's lab, but he canceled class and didn't email anyone. Basically we collected temperature data of a block being heated on a hot plate. The temperature was collected by two thermocouples at different heights on the block, and the sides were insulated. We also measured the power supplied to the hot plate. However, we only collected the final temperature I'm entering my second year of grad school and am looking to replace my old 15" Dell Inspiron from undergrad. Since I already have a gaming desktop at home and a workstation in my office, I'm looking to downsize to something small, portable, and powerful enough that I can keep working when I travel. In particular, I'm looking for a 13" or less 2-in-1 setup with stylus support for note taking. After doing some research I've found a few candidates, but wanted to get some more opinions before </p>
